# Aero: A Theoretical and Practical Examination

## Abstract
This document provides an in-depth analysis of a Kotlin-based multiplatform graphical user interface (GUI) framework, architected upon declarative programming paradigms inspired by **Jetpack Compose**.

## Introduction
### Rationale and Design Motivation
The evolution of modern UI development has necessitated the adoption of declarative paradigms, particularly in the realm of multiplatform applications. Traditional imperative UI programming presents significant challenges in terms of state management and code maintainability. By embracing the declarative approach, the Aero framework aims to simplify UI development, enhance code readability, and improve cross-platform compatibility.

Drawing inspiration from **Jetpack Compose**, the framework enables UI elements to be structured as functions, dynamically recalibrating their representation in response to state mutations. Concurrently, it leverages the power of the Kotlin programming language to deliver a seamless and productive development experience.

## Key Features
- **Declarative UI Construction**: UI components are defined as composable functions, facilitating clarity, modularity, and testability.
- **Efficient State Management**: Through **mutableStateOf**, recomposition is optimized to minimize redundant rendering operations.
- **Cross-Platform Interoperability**: The framework seamlessly integrates across OpenGL, Skija, and Vulkan, ensuring a unified development experience.
- **Component-Based Modularity**: Function-oriented UI construction fosters reusability and separation of concerns.
- **Performance Optimization via Selective Recomposition**: Only state-dependent UI elements undergo re-evaluation, preventing unnecessary reprocessing.
- **Adherence to Platform UX Guidelines**: Jetpack Compose’s reactive principles and Apple’s HIG serve as referential frameworks for intuitive and aesthetically coherent designs.

## Architectural Overview

### Declarative Component Structure
Each UI component is structured as a **pure function** that derives its presentation from an encapsulated state object. This abstraction enables a reactive UI that dynamically synchronizes with data state changes.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun CounterApp() {
    var count by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }
    Column {
        Text("Count: $count")
        Button("Increment") { count++ }
    }
}
```

- **State Encapsulation (`mutableStateOf`)**: Establishes reactive bindings between UI components and their underlying data models.
- **Declarative Event Handling (`Button` Interaction)**: Ensures seamless UI mutations while adhering to unidirectional data flow principles.
- **Composable UI Functions (`@Composable`)**: Denotes modular UI units that participate in the composition tree.

### Theoretical Model of Recomposition
Recomposition is orchestrated through a state-diffing mechanism that recalibrates only the affected UI subsets. The recomposition process can be visualized through the following flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as UI Composition Tree
    participant State as Reactive State Object
    participant Engine as Rendering Engine

    State->>Engine: State Change Detection
    Engine->>UI: Compute Affected Components
    UI->>Engine: Selective Recomposition Execution
```

This methodology ensures **computational efficiency** by limiting reprocessing operations to **differentially affected components**.

### Separation of Rendering API/Backend
To enhance modularity and maintainability, the rendering API/backend is separated from the main part of the framework. This is achieved through a sub-Gradle project (e.g., `skija-gl`) that implements the rendering API.

### Compose API Integration
The compose API is designed to support multiple screens, such as HUD and GUI, which contain windows that can be moved, fixed, hidden, or customized in various ways. This flexibility allows developers to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MainScreen() {
    Screen(title = "Main Screen") {
        Window(title = "Main Window", movable = true, fixed = false, hideable = true) {
            // Window content here
        }
        Window(title = "HUD", movable = false, fixed = true, hideable = true) {
            // HUD content here
        }
    }
}
```

### Runtime Modifiable Flags
The framework includes flags that can be modified at runtime, allowing seamless adjustments to the application's behavior and appearance without requiring a restart.

```kotlin
var darkModeEnabled by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }

@Composable
fun SettingsScreen() {
    Switch(
        checked = darkModeEnabled,
        onCheckedChange = { darkModeEnabled = it },
        label = { Text("Enable Dark Mode") }
    )
}
```

### Event Handling and Settings
To handle key presses and other events, the framework provides a mechanism to define and manage event listeners. There are settings available to enable or disable specific event listeners at runtime.

```kotlin
var listenToKeyEvents by remember { mutableStateOf(true) }

@Composable
fun EventHandlingScreen() {
    if (listenToKeyEvents) {
        // Logic for handling key presses
    }
    Switch(
        checked = listenToKeyEvents,
        onCheckedChange = { listenToKeyEvents = it },
        label = { Text("Enable Key Event Listening") }
    )
}
```

## Practical Implementations
### Case Study: Dynamic Todo List
```kotlin
@Composable
fun TodoApp() {
    var todos by remember { mutableStateOf(listOf("Buy Milk", "Read Book")) }
    var newTodo by remember { mutableStateOf("") }
    
    Column {
        TextField(value = newTodo, onValueChange = { newTodo = it })
        Button("Add Todo") {
            if (newTodo isNotBlank()) {
                todos = todos + newTodo
                newTodo = ""
            }
        }
        todos.forEach { todo -> Text(todo) }
    }
}
```

### Computational Complexity of Recomposition
- **Localized Recomposition**: When a new item is appended to `todos`, only the relevant `Column` recomposes, preserving computational efficiency.
- **Independent State Mutations**: The `TextField` operates autonomously, avoiding unnecessary re-renders of the todo list.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[User Input] -->|State Update| B[Recomposition Trigger]
    B -->|Identifies Relevant Components| C[Partial UI Update]
    C -->|Efficient Rendering| D[Updated Todo List]
```

## Advanced State Management
### Scoped State Preservation
Encapsulating state within specific composable functions prevents global recomposition, thereby maintaining localized performance efficiency.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ParentComponent() {
    var parentState by remember { mutableStateOf("Parent State") }
    Column {
        Text("Parent: $parentState")
        ChildComponent()
    }
}

@Composable
fun ChildComponent() {
    var childState by remember { mutableStateOf("Child State") }
    Column {
        Text("Child: $childState")
        Button("Update Child") { childState = "Updated Child State" }
    }
}
```

Here, **state isolation** ensures that modifications to `childState` do not trigger unnecessary recompositions in `ParentComponent`.

### Optimization of Large-Scale Datasets
Efficient rendering of extensive datasets necessitates virtualization techniques. The framework employs **lazy composition** to restrict rendering to visible UI elements.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun LargeList(items: List<String>) {
    LazyColumn {
        items(items) { item ->
            Text(item)
        }
    }
}
```

Through **lazy rendering**, inactive list elements are deferred until explicitly required, conserving memory and processing resources.
